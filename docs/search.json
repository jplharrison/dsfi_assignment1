It provides the President of South Africa the opportunity to report on the status of the nation to a joint sitting of the two houses of Parliament, the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, and the country’s population at large. The address outlines the government’s agenda, priorities, and policy objectives for the upcoming year. The address will often include a reflection of country’s progress and policy performance since the previous address (South African Government, 2023). In the years in which an election is held, the SONA occurs twice, pre- and post-elections."
