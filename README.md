STA5073Z â€“ Data Science for Industry 2023 - Assignment 1

## Context

The State of the Nation Address of the President of South Africa (SONA) is an annual event in which the President of South Africa reports on the status of the nation, normally to the resumption of a joint sitting of Parliament. You have been provided with full text of all State of the Nation Address (SONA) speeches, from 1994 through to 2022 (sourced from https://www.gov.za/state-nation-address). In years that elections took place, a State of the Nation Address happens twice, once before and again after the election. 

## Objectives

- Your overall goal for this project is to construct at least three predictive models that take a
sentence of text as input and return a prediction of which president was the source of that
sentence, and to write a short scientific paper (word limit: 4500) on this work that you will host
on your own website. S

### Analytical skills:

1. To be able to work with (i.e. read in, parse, clean, manipulate) text data.

2. To create appropriate test, validation, and training datasets and assess classifier performance correctly.

3. To choose which aspects of the problem/data you are going to vary as part of your research paper. This could involve, for example, different approaches to structuring the input data  e.g. top 200 words, top 100 words, bag-of-words vs tf-idf, etc), different predictive approaches (this is required to some extent, see next point), different approaches to training and testing.

4. To be able to fit appropriate predictive models to the data. This must include a feedforward neural network. Other options are classification trees, random forests, multinomial logit regression, and more advanced neural networks like CNNs or RNNs. 

### Workflow skills:

1. To be able to write up your work in the format of a short scientific paper.
2. To be able to host your paper on a GitHub Pages website, linked to your GitHub repository
that you push to programmatically.
